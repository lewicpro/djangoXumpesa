    <h3>Return Policy</h3>
        <p>
            We want you to be fully satisfied with every item you purchase from Market. If you are not happy with any of our products for any reason, weâ€™ll gladly refund your money within 15 days of purchase.

    <h3>Online Returns</h3>
        <p>
            If you're not satisfied with your purchase, most items may be returned by mail or at any of our Xamarket store locations in original condition within 15 days of purchase. Returns will be refunded in the same form of tender as the original transaction.

    <h3>Preparing Your Return By Mail</h3>
    <h5>Small Parcel (I.e. FedEx) Returns</h5>
        <p>

        Detach the top of the invoice and keep it for your records.
        Pack the item(s) securely in the original packaging.
        Complete the return reason questionnaire on the original packing slip and place it inside the box.
        If your shipping receipt included a pre-paid return label, please affix it on to your return package.
        Before sending your return shipment, please remove all extra labels from the outside of the package.
        Many of the orders will include a prepaid UPS return label. If using the pre-paid return label, please follow steps 1-5 directly above and proceed to drop off your package at any UPS drop off location. No postage is necessary; $6.50 will be deducted from your return credit for use of the label.

        If you would prefer to use your own shipping method instead of the pre-paid option on the packing slip or the label was not included on your packing ship, please follow steps 1-3 above and contact XaMarket Customer Care at 0719060504 for help facilitating your return to the returns processing center.

        <h5>Freight Returns</h5>
        If you are not satisfied with the purchase, and the item was originally delivered by one of our oversized freight companies, please call the Xamarket Customer Care Team at 0719060504 for help with your oversized return.
